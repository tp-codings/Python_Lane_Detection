| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (5/5) | 2023 | Python | OpenCV | Tool |

## Features
- Real time Lane Detection from videos
- Visualization
- Offset to center visualization

# Getting Started 
## Prerequisites
- Tested with Pyhton 3.8 and Python 3.12
- This application is tested in windows 10/11
- I don't guarantee that every corner case has been taken into account. The project is part of my learning process for Python

## Installation
1. Clone Repository
`git clone https://github.com/tp-codings/Python_Lane_Detection.git`
2. (optional but recommenced) Create Conda Environment
`conda create -n "LaneDetection" python=3.8`
`conda activate LaneDetection
3. Install Dependencies 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage
`python Lane_Detection.py`
If needed, change video and path in code (no argparser o.s.)

# Examples


# Open Issues and Limitations
- ROI has to be placed manually
- it is not the best thing, but it works for this video quite fine :)
- it struggles hard with bad lighting conditions
- there is much room for improvement
