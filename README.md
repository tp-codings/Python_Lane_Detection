- Python Version: 3.8

## Installation
1. Clone Repository
`git clone https://github.com/tp-codings/Python_Lane_Detection.git`
2. Create Conda Environment
`conda create -n "LaneDetection" python=3.8`
`conda activate LaneDetection
3. Install Dependencies 
`pip install opencv-python`
`pip install numpy`

# Usage
`python Lane_Detection.py`
If needed, change video and path.

# Examples


# Open Issues and Limitations
- ROI has to be placed manually
- it is not the best thing, but it works for this video quite fine :)
- it struggles hard with bad lighting conditions
- there is much room for improvement
